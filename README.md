# Further-Correlation-in-MOEA
The project investigates correlations in multi-objective optimization problems, focusing on the Fonseca-Fleming problem and specific problems within the Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) suite.
Project Objectives and Motivation
Multi-objective optimization involves optimizing two or more conflicting objectives, where evolutionary algorithms (EAs) like NSGA-II guide the search for a Pareto-optimal front—a set of non-dominated solutions offering trade-offs between objectives. In real-world problems, objectives are often correlated, affecting the convergence and spread of solutions. Understanding these correlations is critical for effective algorithm selection and tuning. This project investigates whether specific MOEAs perform better under certain correlation scenarios by focusing on two benchmark problems: Fonseca-Fleming and selected BBOB functions.

Experimental Design
The experiments utilize NSGA-II, a popular domination-based MOEA, due to its robustness across diverse problem structures. Each problem's objective space is sampled to quantify correlations, then visualized to analyze how the relationships between objectives influence optimization outcomes.

Problem Definition:

Fonseca-Fleming Problem: A bi-objective benchmark problem with theoretical Pareto-optimal fronts, making it well-suited for correlation analysis. Fonseca-Fleming’s objectives are mathematically defined, and sampling techniques capture the relationship between decision variables and objective outcomes.
BBOB Problems: The BBOB suite provides complex, real-world-inspired test cases for optimization algorithms. BBOB problems vary in dimensionality, landscape ruggedness, and correlation levels, offering diverse scenarios for algorithm evaluation. Selected problems from this suite enable comparison with Fonseca-Fleming under different optimization landscapes.
Algorithm Setup and Termination Criteria: NSGA-II is configured with population size, crossover probability, and mutation rate tailored to each problem's complexity. Termination criteria are also adaptable:

Generation-based termination halts after a set number of generations, standard for baseline comparisons.
Hypervolume-based termination leverages hypervolume indicators, stopping when the algorithm reaches a pre-defined hypervolume threshold relative to a reference point. Hypervolume-based termination provides insights into how quickly NSGA-II converges toward a high-quality Pareto front.
Sampling and Correlation Calculation: Sampling methods capture the distribution and correlation of objective values across decision spaces. For example, grid-based and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) generate data points across a specified range, approximating each problem’s objective space:

Grid Sampling is used for the Fonseca-Fleming problem, offering a systematic approach to capture objective relationships.
LHS Sampling is employed for BBOB problems, particularly useful for higher-dimensional spaces.
Correlation matrices are then calculated to quantify relationships among objectives. These correlations are analyzed within grid sections of the objective space, providing localized views of correlation dynamics.

Visualization Techniques: To effectively interpret correlations, the project generates:

Decision Space Heatmaps: Visual representations of correlations between decision variables. These heatmaps reveal areas with strong or weak correlations, guiding adjustments in optimization strategies.
Objective Space Heatmaps: For each problem, objective spaces are divided into subspaces, with each region color-coded based on its correlation level. High-correlation areas suggest a need for algorithms that balance objective trade-offs, while low-correlation regions may suit algorithms emphasizing diversity.
Results and Analysis
The experiments reveal distinct correlation patterns across Fonseca-Fleming and BBOB problems, influencing NSGA-II’s performance:

Fonseca-Fleming Problem: NSGA-II performs consistently, converging to a well-distributed Pareto front. Correlation heatmaps show moderate correlation in the objective space, which aligns with NSGA-II’s ability to balance objectives with limited trade-offs.
BBOB Problems: Results vary across BBOB functions, with high-correlation regions posing challenges for NSGA-II in maintaining solution diversity. Some BBOB problems exhibit highly rugged landscapes with regions of strong objective correlation, requiring adaptive crossover and mutation strategies. NSGA-II shows slower convergence and reduced hypervolume in such cases, suggesting that algorithmic adjustments are necessary for complex, high-correlation landscapes.
Discussion and Recommendations
The study demonstrates that objective correlations significantly impact NSGA-II’s effectiveness, particularly in problems with highly correlated or rugged landscapes. While NSGA-II provides reliable performance for Fonseca-Fleming and some BBOB functions, its ability to adapt to high-correlation scenarios remains limited. This finding supports using correlation analysis as a tool for algorithm selection, especially when facing unknown objective structures.

For practitioners, correlation heatmaps can be valuable diagnostic tools. High-correlation regions may indicate the need for decomposition-based algorithms, like MOEA/D, that handle specific objective groupings more effectively. In contrast, low-correlation or less rugged problems are well-suited to NSGA-II’s diversity-oriented approach.

Future Work
Future studies could incorporate additional MOEAs, such as decomposition or indicator-based algorithms, to evaluate performance across BBOB problems with different correlation structures. Parallel experiments on high-dimensional BBOB problems would also offer insights into correlation dynamics in more complex spaces. Moreover, integrating machine learning techniques to predict algorithm performance based on correlation patterns could advance automated MOEA selection, improving efficiency in real-world applications.

Summary
This project advances multi-objective optimization research by examining how objective correlations influence algorithmic performance on Fonseca-Fleming and BBOB problems. Through rigorous correlation analysis and visualization, it highlights the importance of matching algorithms to correlation characteristics, guiding more effective optimization in complex, multi-objective scenarios.
